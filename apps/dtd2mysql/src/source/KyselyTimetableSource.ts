 * in it do not translate:
 *
 * - `cate_interchange_status <=> 9` is MySQL's null safe equals. A CASE says the same thing everywhere,
 *   including for the null the operator quietly treats as "not 9".
 * - `IF(train_status = "S", ...)` is a MySQL function; CASE is the standard spelling.
 * - matching a fixed link on `CONCAT(origin, destination)` can match the wrong link, because the codes
 *   are glued together before they are compared. `AB` + `CDE` and `ABC` + `DE` are the same string.
 * - a bare `GROUP BY crs_code` with columns that are not in it. MySQL answers by choosing a row for you
 *   and Postgres rejects the query outright, so the row is chosen here instead.
 *
 * The queries are built rather than written, so they are checked against the schema declarations rather
 * than being strings that happen to name columns.
