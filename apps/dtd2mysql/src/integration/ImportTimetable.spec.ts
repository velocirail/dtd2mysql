/**
 * Imports the mini timetable feed and records every row it wrote.
 *
 * The point of this is the expected rows file. The same file is the expectation for MySQL, Postgres and
 * SQLite: a database needing its own is a bug rather than something to record. Run vitest with -u to
 * update it, and treat any change to it as something to explain rather than accept.
 *
 * The fixture is RJTTF001.ZIP, a slice of the real RJTTF918 refresh that dtd2gtfs commits for its golden
 * feed - 7,336 MCA lines seeded from named TUIDs covering the STP stacks, the joins and splits, the
 * services running past midnight and one z-train of each category.
 *
 * It carries the header and trailer lines the real feeds do, so the record count and the row count do
 * not match: the MSN holds 205 A records and 204 stations arrive. The extra one is the FILE-SPEC header,
 * whose S lands on the interchange status field and which used to be imported as a station with a CRS
 * code of 0/1. MSN.isRecord excludes it now, and 204 is what says so.
