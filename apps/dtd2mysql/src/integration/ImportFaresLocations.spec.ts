/**
 * The same fares feed, with real records rather than generated ones.
 *
 * RJFAF001.ZIP is the slice of the RJFAF847 refresh dtd2gtfs commits: the LOC file only, holding the
 * records the station groups extension reads. It is narrow - one file of forty odd lines against the
 * generated fixture's nineteen - but every line is real, including a group name padded out to its fixed
 * width, which is what says the padding is dropped on the way in rather than stored.
 *
 * The two fixtures answer different questions and both are kept: this one that real records parse and
 * store, the generated one that all forty five tables round trip.
