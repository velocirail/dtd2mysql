 * The tables --gtfs-import loads into have to agree with the feed the build writes, and nothing else
 * says so.
 *
 * The loader matches a value to a column by the file's header rather than by position, so the two orders
 * are free to differ - which they do, stops.txt writing its coordinates last. What is not free is a
 * column the file has and the table does not: the loader stops on one rather than dropping the value, so
 * a feed that gains a field fails the import until it is declared. That is what this catches first.
 *
 * The golden feed belongs to dtd2gtfs, which is the only committed example of what this build produces.
 * Reading it across the workspace is the point: the two have to match.
